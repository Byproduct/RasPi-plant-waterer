RasPi plant irrigator thingy
----------------------------

Here is where you configure plants.
Format: Plant;plant name;soil sensor GPIO pin number;water pump GPIO number;time to pump water (in seconds)
Example: "Plant;Tomato;16;10;5" -- this means a plant called Tomato uses GPIO pin 16 for the sensor, GPIO pin 10 for the pump, and each time it's watered, the pump runs for 5 seconds.
Use BCM numbers for the pins (not BOARD numbers).
Enter as many plants as you like. The limit is the number of available GPIO pins, so about 10 plants maximum.

Plant;Maja-tomaatit;10;16;10
Plant;Ruukkutomaatit;9;20;10
Plant;Pihvitomaatit;11;21;7
Plant;Pagels-chili;8;26;7

GPIO pin number of the relay for powering the moisture sensors
Sensor_power_gpio;25

Debug mode - if set to "true", prints out more information when running the script. If everything works, this is not required.
Debug_mode;true

Discord bot enabled - if set to "true", sends notifications via a discord bot (see discordbot.py). If disabled, you don't need to set up a discord bot.
Discord_bot_enabled;true
